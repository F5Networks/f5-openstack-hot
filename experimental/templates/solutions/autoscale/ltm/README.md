## Introduction

This solution uses a Heat template to launch the deployment of F5 Virtual Edition (VE) instances in **OS::Heat::AutoScalingGroup** that can scale arbitrary resources. The BIG-IP VEs have the <a href="https://f5.com/products/big-ip/local-traffic-manager-ltm">Local Traffic Manager</a> (LTM) module enabled to provide advanced traffic management functionality.

In this auto scale solution, as thresholds are met, the number of BIG-IP VE LTM instances automatically increases or decreases accordingly. Scaling thresholds are by default based on **network.incoming.bytes.rate** meter. The meter type can be changed by providing the parameter value. This solution is for BIG-IP LTM only.

The BIG-IP VE(s) are configured in 2-NIC mode. In a 2-NIC implementation, each BIG-IP VE has one interface used for management and data-plane traffic from the Internet, and the second interface connected into the Neutron networks where traffic is processed by the pool members in a traditional two-ARM design. Traffic flows from the BIG-IP VE to the application servers.

This solution uses (requires) a [BIG-IQ device](https://f5.com/products/big-iq-centralized-management) with a pool of BIG-IP VE licenses to automatically license the auto scaled BIG-IP VEs.

The **autoscale_ltm** heat orchestration template incorporates existing networks defined in Neutron.

## Prerequisites and Configuration Notes
  - You must have an existing BIG-IQ device with a pool of BIG-IP LTM licenses to use this solution.
  - The autoscale ltm solution consists of two templates that configure clustering:
    - *f5_bigip_autoscale_ltm_2_nic.yaml*, the parent template that needs to be specified as the template parameter.
    - *f5_bigip_autoscale_ltm_instance_2_nic.yaml*, the BIG-IP instance-specific template referenced by the parent template.
  - There are no fixed IP addresses for the interfaces. The addresses will be determined upon Neutron port creation.
  - If you do not specify a URL override (the parameter name is **f5_cloudlibs_url_override**), the default location is GitHub and the subnet for the management network requires a route and access to the Internet for the initial configuration to download the BIG-IP cloud library.
  - If you specify a value for **f5_cloudlibs_url_override** or **f5_cloudlibs_tag**, ensure that corresponding hashes are valid by either updating scripts/verifyHash or by providing a **f5_cloudlibs_verify_hash_url_override** value.
  - **Important**: This [article](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13092#userpassword) contains links to information regarding BIG-IP user and password management. Take note of the following when supplying password values:
      - The BIG-IP version and any default policies that may apply
      - Any characters recommended that you avoid
  - This template can send non-identifiable statistical information to F5 Networks to help us improve our templates. See [Sending statistical information to F5](#sending-statistical-information-to-f5).
  - In order to pass traffic from your clients to the servers, after launching the template, you must create virtual server(s) on the BIG-IP VE.
  - This template includes a master election feature, which ensures that if the existing master BIG-IP VE is unavailable, a new master is selected from the BIG-IP VEs in the cluster.
  - This template leverages the following built-in heat resource types:
      - *OS::Heat::WaitCondition* to track status of onboarding by sending signals to the orchestration API.
      - *OS::Ceilometer::Alarm* and *OS::Heat::AutoScalingGroup* to trigger the autoscaling of resources.
      - *OS::Heat::SwiftSignal* to create an endpoint for autoscaling metadata used in master election.
  - **Important**: You may need to perform additional configuration for the OpenStack services Ceilometer (metering) and Swift (container) in your environment in order to utilize this template. This template also requires a user account with sufficient privileges to perform Ceilometer, Swift and Heat operations.

## Security
This Heat Orchestration Template downloads helper code to configure the BIG-IP system. If you want to verify the integrity of the template, you can open and modify the definition of the **verifyHash** file in **/scripts/verifyHash**.

Additionally, F5 provides checksums for all of our supported OpenStack heat templates. For instructions and the checksums to compare against, see this [DevCentral link](https://devcentral.f5.com/codeshare/checksums-for-f5-supported-cft-and-arm-templates-on-github-1014) .

Instance configuration data is retrieved from the metadata service. OpenStack supports encrypting the metadata traffic.
If SSL is enabled in your environment, ensure that calls to the metadata service in the templates are updated accordingly.
For more information, please refer to:
- https://docs.openstack.org/heat/latest/template_guide/software_deployment.html
- https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/security.html#encrypt-compute-metadata-traffic


## Supported instance types and OpenStack versions:
 - BIG-IP Virtual Edition Image Version 13.0 or later
 - OpenStack Mitaka Deployment

### Getting Help
While this template has been created by F5 Networks, it is in the experimental directory and therefore has not completed full testing and is subject to change.  F5 Networks does not offer technical support for templates in the experimental directory. For supported templates, see the templates in the **supported** directory.

**Community Support**  
We encourage you to use our [Slack channel](https://f5cloudsolutions.herokuapp.com) for discussion and assistance on F5 OpenStack Heat Orchestration templates. There are F5 employees who are members of this community who typically monitor the channel Monday-Friday 9-5 PST and will offer best-effort assistance. This slack channel community support should **not** be considered a substitute for F5 Technical Support. See the [Slack Channel Statement](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-openstack-hot/blob/master/slack-channel-statement.md) for guidelines on using this channel.

## Launching Stacks

1. Ensure the prerequisites are configured in your environment. See the README from this project's root folder.
2. Clone this repository or manually download the contents (zip/tar). As the templates use nested stacks and referenced components, we recommend you retain the project structure as is for ease of deployment. If any of the files changed location, make sure that the corresponding paths are updated in the environment files.
3. Locate and update the environment file (`_env.yaml`) with the appropriate parameter values. Note that some default values are used if no value is specified for an optional parameter.
4. Launch the stack using the OpenStack CLI with a command using the following syntax::

#### CLI Syntax
`openstack stack create <stackname> -t <path-to-template> -e <path-to-env>`

#### CLI Example
```
openstack stack create stack-autoscale-ltm -t src/f5-openstack-hot/experimental/templates/solutions/autoscale/ltm/f5_bigip_autoscale_ltm_instance_2_nic.yaml -e src/f5-openstack-hot/experimental/templates/solutions/autoscale/ltm/f5_bigip_autoscale_ltm_instance_2_nic.yaml
```

### Sending statistical information to F5
All of the F5 templates now have an option to send anonymous statistical data to F5 Networks to help us improve future templates.  
None of the information we collect is personally identifiable, and only includes:

- Customer ID: this is a hash of the project ID, not the actual ID
- Deployment ID: hash of stack ID
- F5 template name
- F5 template version
- Cloud Name
- Region: this is a hash of the region (if supplied as parameter)
- BIG-IP version
- F5 license type
- F5 Cloud libs version
- F5 script name

This information is critical to the future improvements of templates, but should you decide to select **No**, information will not be sent to F5.
